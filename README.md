# TeamGenerator
In the employee, engineer, intern, and manager.js files. I created classes of the prospective names. Then i created a constructor function with 3 parameters called nameParam, idParam, emailParam. In the intern i added school, in the manager i added officeNumber, and in engineer added gitHubUser. I then used the getRole() function to return the specfic employee. At the end of the page i used a modules.export = the class. After that i mainly worked in the app.js file. Where i created a const Team [] array. Then i created a mainMenu function inside i used an inquirer prompt then i created type, name, message and choices strings inside that function.. after i used a .then function response, with 4 different if statements that include memberManager(), memberIntern(), memberEngineer(), and makeTeam(). I then in each of those functions used return inquirer.prompt, and created 4 different objects with type, name and message. After that i used another .then function(answers) parameter. I created a const for each employee with their perspective name, and created a new const with answers.name, answer.Id, answers.email, answers.officeNumber. I fianlly made a function makeTeam with an if statement 
(!fs.existsSync(OUTPUT_DIR)) {
        fs.mkdirSync(OUTPUT_DIR) and finished with fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, render(team), "utf-8"); to create the team.html
